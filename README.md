# ü™Ö Self-learning Pixi.js
I came across PHQ and was captivated by their creative works (http://www.phantom.land/). Their projects inspired me to dive into PixiJS! 
I have a huge interest in creative and aesthetic design, and I believe that technology, combined with innovative design, can bring exceptional ideas to life.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- Followed the official PixiJS documentation: PixiJS Docs(https://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html).
- Used PixiJS Create CLI to set up the project environment.
- To run the application, 
```

npm run dev
```

### Things I learned
- Credit to @cmiscm:
I followed one of his tutorial videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMQ9fEX28fk.
Since the video was recorded 4 years ago and the code was written in JavaScript, I rewrote it in TypeScript to bring it up to date and align it with modern coding practices.
- Created custom functions:
Developed functions such as Text and Visual to have complete control over their behaviour and to extend their capabilities with additional methods.
- Getting there...:
I couldn't fully understand his code‚Äîespecially the animation part‚Äî but I gained a brief understanding of the overall structure and I made it work anyway:D
